Here’s how I tackle each question inside Excel:
1. Average discount % by category
Pivot Table: Rows: category
Values: Average of discount_percent_calc
2. Product count per category
Pivot Table: Rows: category
Values: Count of product_name
3. Total reviews per category
Values: Sum of rating_count
4. Highest rated products
Sort the main table by rating descending
5. Avg. actual vs discounted price by category
Values: Average of actual_price and discounted_price
6. Most reviewed products
Sort by rating_count descending
7. Products with ≥50% discount
Filter: discount_percent_calc ≥ 0.50
8. Rating distribution
Pivot Table: Rows: rating
Values: Count of product_name
9. Total potential revenue per category
Values: Sum of potential_revenue
10. Product count per price bucket

Use Excel chart: Scatter plot
X-axis: discount_percent_calc

12. Products with <1,000 reviews
Filter: rating_count < 1000
13. Categories with highest discounts
